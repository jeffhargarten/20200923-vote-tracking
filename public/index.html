			<p>The high-stakes 2020 general election has kicked into gear, with many Minnesotans requesting, receiving and sending back absentee ballots. Some drop off their absentee ballots in-person at local voting centers, while others live in rural mail-only precincts.</p>

			<p>No-excuse absentee voting has been available in Minnesota since 2014 and has become an increasingly popular option with every passing election, but this one is likely to take the cake. In Minnesota’s <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-2020-primary-results-vote-election/570671321/?refresh=true">August primary</a>, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/6-of-10-minnesota-primary-voters-cast-ballots-absentee-or-by-mail/568966771/#comment">a majority of voters cast their ballots absentee</a>, including upwards of 80 to 90% of voters in Greater Minnesota.</p>

			<p>Record numbers of mail ballots are expected to be counted for November’s general election, and in our September Minnesota Poll, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/poll-minnesota-voters-split-on-integrity-of-mail-in-voting/572533691/">more than a third of respondents</a> indicated they would plan to vote early rather than in person on Election Day. The tally from the Secretary of State’s office updates on Fridays leading up to Nov. 3, but in the meantime, read up on where Minnesota’s <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-voters-guide-2020-election-senate-house-candidates-who-is-running-gop-dfl-issues/572227401/">major candidates stand on key issues</a>, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/how-to-vote-2020-elections-minnesota-voting-absentee-president-senate-congress-covid-19-coronavirus/572227371/">how to register and vote</a>, and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/what-happens-to-your-minnesota-mail-in-absentee-ballot-after-you-mail-it-votes-counted/572029141/?refresh=true">what happens to an absentee ballot after it’s sent</a>, and keep up-to-date by subscribing to our <a href="http://newsletters.startribune.com/pages/1788361/4540">Politics newsletter</a>, penned by reporters daily.</p>
